Active Accounts: 85 active accounts (small startups <200 employees to large enterprises 5,000+ employees) | ✔ Yes | Answered by attaching novatech_company_background.pdf directly to the chat (file-upload / "Document" attachment flow), since this knowledge base is unstructured text rather than a dataset. |

## Cross-Check

Pick one fact from above and confirm it independently in the QuickSight dataset preview.

- **Fact verified:** 85 unique/active accounts (rows #1 and #7 above).
- **Chat said:** 85 unique accounts (from NovaTech CRM Deals dataset) and 85 active accounts (from the company background reference document) — two independent knowledge bases agree.
- **QuickSight shows:** Opened `novatech_crm_deals.csv` in the dataset editor and added a temporary Aggregate transform step (Count Distinct on `account_id`). The preview returned **85** as the distinct count. The change was not saved (Cancel was clicked) so the underlying dataset was left untouched.
- **Consistent?** Yes — all three independent checks (Quick Chat over the CRM dataset, Quick Chat over the Reference Documents PDF, and a direct aggregation in the QuickSight dataset editor) agree on 85 accounts, confirming both data integrity and the accuracy of Q's answers.
